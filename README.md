# Can one Hear the shape of gender ?

> Prior work showed that the modal human body has seven holes, irrespective of biological gender, which showed that gender is not a topological invariant. We conjecture that genders can be classified according to torsion and curvature, up to rigid motion, but that only spectral information is not enough. We check this conjecture empirically by training a machine learning model to classify meshes of male/female bodies based on topological and geometric features, and compute pairs of non-isogender isospectral bodies.
