abstract = {We develop a novel approach to generate human body models in a variety of shapes and poses via tuning semantic parameters. Our approach is investigated with datasets of up to 3000 scanned body models which have been placed in point to point correspondence. Correspondence is established by nonrigid deformation of a template mesh. The large dataset allows a local model to be learned robustly, in which individual parts of the human body can be accurately reshaped according to semantic parameters. We evaluate performance on two datasets and find that our model outperforms existing methods.},
